# AWS Bedrock Inference Benchmarks

This directory contains scripts and data for benchmarking different AWS Bedrock inference methods.

## Purpose

The benchmarking tools help quantify and visualize:

1. **Performance characteristics** of different inference methods
2. **Throughput optimization** under quota constraints
3. **Latency measurements** across various workloads
4. **Cost efficiency** comparisons
5. **Scaling behavior** under different load patterns

## Benchmark Suites

### Basic Benchmarks
- Single request latency across models
- Token generation speed
- Error rates and retry analysis

### Throughput Benchmarks
- Requests per minute (RPM) maximization strategies
- Tokens per minute (TPM) optimization
- Request batching efficiency

### Scaling Benchmarks
- Parallel request performance
- Streaming vs. non-streaming comparison
- Asynchronous job throughput

### Quota Utilization Benchmarks
- Quota consumption patterns
- Throttling behavior analysis
- Recovery strategies effectiveness

## Visualization Tools

The benchmarks generate visualization-ready data for:

- Line charts showing throughput over time
- Comparison bar charts for different methods
- Heatmaps for parameter optimization
- Scatter plots for latency distribution

## Using Benchmark Data in Blog Posts

The benchmark data and visualizations provide concrete evidence for blog post claims:

1. Include screenshots of visualization outputs
2. Present numeric findings in formatted tables
3. Compare approaches with side-by-side metrics
4. Show quota utilization patterns
5. Demonstrate optimization results with before/after comparisons

### Code Example Standards

Each code example must:

1. Be complete and runnable (not fragments)
2. Include proper imports
3. Show proper AWS authentication using the project standard
4. Include comprehensive error handling
5. Use consistent naming conventions
6. Have detailed comments explaining key decisions
7. Demonstrate best practices
8. Be validated in a real AWS environment

### Multiple Implementation Approaches

When demonstrating multiple ways to implement the same functionality:

1. **Use Tabbed Code Display**
   ```html
   <div class="code-tabs">
     <button class="tablinks active" onclick="openTab(event, 'Python')">Python (Boto3)</button>
     <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'CLI')">AWS CLI</button>
     <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'Terraform')">Terraform</button>
   </div>

   <div id="Python" class="tabcontent" style="display:block;">
   ```python
   # Python implementation with boto3
   ```
   </div>

   <div id="CLI" class="tabcontent">
   ```bash
   # AWS CLI implementation
   ```
   </div>

   <div id="Terraform" class="tabcontent">
   ```hcl
   # Terraform implementation
   ```
   </div>
   ```

2. **Ensure Equivalence**
   - All implementations should achieve the exact same result
   - Use consistent variable/resource naming across implementations
   - Highlight the key differences in approach

3. **Implementation Priority**
   - Python (Boto3) implementation is primary and most detailed
   - AWS CLI for command-line operations
   - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CDK, CloudFormation) where appropriate

### Example Code Structure

```python
import boto3
import json
import time
import logging
from utils.profile_manager import get_profile

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def get_bedrock_client(profile_name=None):
    """
    Create a Bedrock client using the specified AWS profile.
    For local testing, defaults to the 'aws' profile.
    
    Args:
        profile_name: AWS profile name to use
        
    Returns:
        boto3 bedrock-runtime client
    """
    profile = profile_name or get_profile()
    session = boto3.Session(profile_name=profile)
    return session.client('bedrock-runtime')

def example_function(param1, param2):
    """
    Detailed function documentation.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of parameter
        param2: Description of parameter
        
    Returns:
        Description of return value
        
    Raises:
        ThrottlingException: When requests exceed quota
        ValidationException: When invalid parameters are provided
    """
    client = get_bedrock_client()
    
    try:
        # Implementation logic
        result = client.some_operation(...)
        return result
    except client.exceptions.ThrottlingException as e:
        logger.warning(f"Request throttled: {str(e)}")
        # Error handling logic with exponential backoff
    except client.exceptions.ValidationException as e:
        logger.error(f"Validation error: {str(e)}")
        # Handle validation errors
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}")
        # Generic error handling
```

### Writing Style Requirements

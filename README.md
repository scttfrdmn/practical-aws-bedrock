# AWS Bedrock Inference Optimization

A practical guide to AWS Bedrock inference methods, focusing on optimizing throughput within account quota limitations.

## Overview

This project explores the various inference methods available in Amazon Bedrock and provides strategies for maximizing throughput within your account's quota limitations. By understanding the different inference approaches and their tradeoffs, you can select the optimal method for your specific use case.

## Inference Methods

AWS Bedrock supports multiple inference methods, each with different characteristics:

### Synchronous Inference (InvokeModel)
- Single request/response pattern
- Ideal for real-time applications requiring immediate responses
- Subject to tokens-per-minute (TPM) and requests-per-minute (RPM) quotas

### Streaming Inference (InvokeModelWithResponseStream)
- Returns generated content in chunks as it's created
- Reduces time-to-first-token for improved user experience
- Allows for faster apparent response times while staying within TPM limits

### Batch Processing
- Process multiple requests efficiently
- Better utilization of quota limits for non-realtime applications
- Strategies for batching requests to maximize throughput

### Asynchronous Processing (CreateModelInvocationJob)
- Long-running inference jobs for large inputs
- Higher throughput potential for offline processing
- Working with job queues and monitoring

## Quota Optimization Strategies

This project demonstrates techniques for:

- Measuring and monitoring your current quota usage
- Implementing backoff and retry strategies
- Managing token usage through prompt engineering
- Parallelization techniques within quota constraints
- Rate limiting and request scheduling approaches

## Getting Started

[Project setup and usage instructions will be added here]

## Examples

The repository includes examples for different inference scenarios:

- High-volume batch processing
- Real-time chat applications with streaming
- Hybrid approaches for mixed workloads
- Handling quota limits gracefully

# AWS Bedrock Inference Optimization

A practical guide to AWS Bedrock inference methods using Python, focusing on optimizing throughput within account quota limitations.

## Overview

This project explores the various inference methods available in Amazon Bedrock and provides strategies for maximizing throughput within your account's quota limitations. By understanding the different inference approaches and their tradeoffs, you can select the optimal method for your specific use case.

All examples and tutorials use Python with boto3 and AWS Bedrock SDK to demonstrate real-world implementation patterns.

## Inference Methods

AWS Bedrock supports multiple inference methods, each with different characteristics:

### Synchronous Inference (InvokeModel)
- Single request/response pattern
- Ideal for real-time applications requiring immediate responses
- Subject to tokens-per-minute (TPM) and requests-per-minute (RPM) quotas

### Streaming Inference (InvokeModelWithResponseStream)
- Returns generated content in chunks as it's created
- Reduces time-to-first-token for improved user experience
- Allows for faster apparent response times while staying within TPM limits

### Batch Processing
- Process multiple requests efficiently
- Better utilization of quota limits for non-realtime applications
- Strategies for batching requests to maximize throughput

### Asynchronous Processing (CreateModelInvocationJob)
- Long-running inference jobs for large inputs
- Higher throughput potential for offline processing
- Working with job queues and monitoring

### Conversational AI (Converse API)
- Handles multi-turn conversations with context management
- Specialized for chat applications and dialogue systems
- Built-in conversation state tracking and memory management
- Optimizing conversation history within token limits

### Structured Outputs (Construct API)
- Specialized for generating structured data (JSON, XML)
- Enforces output schemas for consistent results
- Strategies for reliable parsing and validation
- Optimizing quota usage with structured generation

## Quota Optimization Strategies

This project demonstrates techniques for:

- Measuring and monitoring your current quota usage
- Implementing backoff and retry strategies
- Managing token usage through prompt engineering
- Parallelization techniques within quota constraints
- Rate limiting and request scheduling approaches

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- AWS Account with access to Amazon Bedrock
- Required Python packages:
  - boto3
  - botocore
  - aws-bedrock-runtime
  - aws-bedrock-sdk
  - concurrent.futures (for parallel processing examples)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-bedrock-inference.git
cd aws-bedrock-inference

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

Set up your AWS credentials using one of the following methods:
- AWS CLI: `aws configure`
- Environment variables
- Credentials file

Ensure you have the appropriate permissions to access Amazon Bedrock services.

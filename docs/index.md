# Practical AWS Bedrock

Welcome to **Practical AWS Bedrock** – a comprehensive, action-oriented guide to building generative AI applications using Amazon Bedrock.

## What You'll Find Here

This resource focuses on real-world implementation patterns rather than theoretical concepts. We've created a practical guide with:

- **Production-ready code** with proper error handling and optimization
- **Step-by-step tutorials** for common use cases
- **Performance optimization techniques** for maximizing throughput
- **Comprehensive documentation** of AWS Bedrock features

## Getting Started

Choose your starting point based on your needs:

### Quick Links

- [Introduction to AWS Bedrock](chapters/getting-started/introduction/)
- [Understanding Foundation Models](chapters/getting-started/foundation-models/)
- [Token Quota Optimization](chapters/optimization/token-quota-optimization/)
- [Complete Learning Path](learning-path/)

## Featured Topics

### Token Quota Optimization

Learn how to maximize AWS Bedrock throughput when facing constraints on token sizes and request limits. Our guide provides practical strategies for balancing these competing constraints.
